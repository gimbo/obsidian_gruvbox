# gimbo's obsidian_grubvox fork

This is my personal fork of the [insanum/obsidian_gruvbox](https://github.com/insanum/obsidian_gruvbox) theme for Obsidian.

Differences include:

* Monospace font in editor.
* Tweaked light theme colours (less creamy).
* Tweaked primary/secondary background colour usage (e.g. in dark theme makes the main editor panel darker than the sidebar, whereas in the original it's the other way round) .
* No max-width for editor/preview (not a feature of obsidian_gruvbox, but default style introduced this, urgh).
* Thicker resize handles.
* Other misc bits and bobs.

Everything from here down is the original README (including the screenshots, which are thus inaccurate, FYI).

# Obsidian + gruvbox

This is a [gruvbox](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox) theme for
[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md). It supports both light and dark modes.

Simply copy the `obsidian.css` file to your vault directory and reload
Obsidian for it to take effect.
